==========================
A standard international 52-card pack is used, and in most forms of poker there are no jokers. 
The rank of the cards, from high to low, is A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. In certain 
circumstances the ace can be used as a low card, below the 2.

There are four suits,(from high to low is S=spade,H=heart, D=diamond and C=club); normally no suit is higher than another, whenever a hand has the same hand ranking the suit is used to determine. 
All poker hands contain five cards, the highest hand wins.
