General Rules
=============
A standard international 52-card pack is used, and in most forms of poker there are no jokers. 
The rank of the cards, from high to low, is A, K, Q, J, T, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2. In certain 
circumstances the ace can be used as a low card, below the 2.

There are four suits,(from high to low is S=spade,H=heart, D=diamond and C=club); normally no suit is higher than another, whenever a hand has the same hand ranking the suit is used to determine. 
All poker hands contain five cards, the highest hand wins. 

How the hands are ranked
------------------------
Hands are ranked as follows(from high to low):

* Straight Flush
* Four of a kind
* Full House
* Flush
* Straight
* Three of a kind
* Two Pair
* Pair
* High Card

	+ General Rule: When hands tie on the rank of a pair, three of a kind, etc, the cards outside break ties following the High Card rules. 

Straight Flush
--------------
A hand that contains five cards in sequence, all of the same suit. Two such hands are compared by their card that is ranked highest.Aces can be used as a low card, below the 2.

Four of a kind
--------------
Four of a kind, also known as quads, that contains all four cards of one rank and any other (unmatched) card.Quads with higher-ranking cards defeat lower-ranking ones.
It is possible for two or more hands to obtain the same quad;in this instance, the unmatched card with the higher-ranking wins; acts as a kicker.

Full House
----------
A full house contains three matching cards of one rank and two matching cards of another rank. Between two full houses, the one with the higher-ranking three cards wins. 
If two hands have the same three cards, the hand with the higher pair wins.

Flush
-----
A flush is a hand where all five cards are of the same suit, but not in sequence. Two flushes are compared as if they were high card hands; the highest-ranking card of each is compared to determine the winner. 
If both hands have the same highest card, then the second highest-ranking card is compared, and so on until a difference is found. If the two flushes contain the same five ranks of cards, when flushes ties, follow the rules for High Card.
